So, we i.e. me and Jyoti grew together. Actually, our father's grew together. Then her father got married, and had a son. 10 year later they had Jyoti (10 years .. :) yeah I know). Anyway, I was born about the same time. No it's not important that my father got married and did a bunch of things. Ofcourse he did. That's how I got born. About 2 months later. Now, fuck why not 2 months earlier? Believe me things would have been easier.

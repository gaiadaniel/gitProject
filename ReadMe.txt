Testing out git things.
It's been a while I really do something interesting and have forgotton a bunch of stuff. Including version control. Since version control tools are intersting and most I worked with was subversion (God, I'm a diansour), will start with learning git. Now git is not really a new tool but process is kind of similar. I just want to understand what git does for me. For now, I've overriddent some of the local configs (actually user.name and user.email only). You can check this in ./git/config. I don't know, though other than me why are you reading it. But since, you are go ahead. 
This file is being created, just to add it to staging and see how that works out. 
Just added and committed this file to repo. Also created a template file to use format but I'm not sure how to enforce that. I guess we will need to learn. There are some URLs that describe pre commit hook. In the git commit man page there is -t or --template option. It also talks about a commit.template environment variable. We will check once we do that.
Learn something. Use present tense instead of past tense in commit message. Helps keeping things simple.
Now trying out diff, see what happens. 
Now making changes on this stupid file on github UI. Let's paly around and then check what happens.
Now serious shit, I'm changing this file again, and I think there is going to be a conflict. That will be fun.
